# Memory-Hierarchy-Simulator
This is my project for Computer Architecture.
I made this code for college.
Its objective is to simulate a memory hierarchy, I did this using the C language.

Prog.txt is an example to simulate instructions for this code.


The code is for a cache with 4 ways and 8 sets.
